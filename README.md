[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/fb-runner-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/fb-runner-node)

Form Builder Runner is an application that provides generic backend code and templates to create forms from data representations.

For more details, read the [Runnerâ€™s documentation](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/form-builder/blob/master/documentation/running/running.md)


## Pre-requisites

  [Node](https://nodejs.org)

## Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/fb-runner-node.git
cd fb-runner-node
npm install
```

## Usage

Set the `SERVICE_PATH` environment variable to point the path of form data on your filesystem.

```sh
SERVICE_PATH=/path/to/form npm start
```

An example form can be checked out from `https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-example-service`

By default, Form Builder Runner will use port 3000. If you want to run on a different port, set the `PORT` environment variable.

```sh
PORT=4321 SERVICE_PATH=/path/to/form npm start
```

### Components usage

By default the runner uses the module `@ministryofjustice/fb-components-core`, using the version defined in `lib/constants/constant.js`

[Read more about components usage](components.md)

### Using the fb-runnner-node with a mocked backend

Use [fb-mock-services](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-mock-services) to mock out the services which your local instance of fb-runner-node (this repo) communicates with.

* In one terminal tab, run the [fb-mock-services](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-mock-services) project according to its instructions (e.g. `MOCKENV=yes npm start`)
* Create an `.envmocks` file within this project, the contents of which are:

```sh
export USER_DATASTORE_URL=http://localhost:44444
export USER_FILESTORE_URL=http://localhost:44445
export SUBMITTER_URL=http://localhost:44446
export SERVICE_SECRET=sekrit
export SERVICE_SLUG=slug
export MODULE__ministryofjustice_fb_components_core='/path/to/your/form-builder/fb-components-core'
```

* Within this `fb-runner-node` repo, run this command: `source .envmocks && SERVICE_PATH=/path/to/your/form npm start`

If you are not developing runner features, consider using the [Form Builder Editor Console](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor-console-electron) instead.

## Debugging

The node inspect can be enabled can be enabled for debugging purposes. Below is an example command to start the application with the inspector

```sh
PORT=30002 SERVICE_PATH=../leavers-form node inspect bin/start.js
```

A breakpoint can then be placed in any JS code with the following statement

```js
debugger
```

## Testing

```
npm test
```

Run unit tests only

```
npm run test:unit
```

Run a single unit test

```
./node_modules/.bin/multi-tape lib/controller/page/type/page.summary/page.summary.controller.unit.spec.js
```

Run linting only
```
npm run lint
```

## To deploy and run on Cloud Platforms

## Module Aliases

Some module paths are _aliased_.

At runtime they are resolved with [`module-alias`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias). Its definitions can be found in the `_moduleAliases {}` field on `package.json`.

During development the aliases can be resolved in different ways according to needs of the developer's IDE. A solution we provide is via Webpack, [which is supported automatically in WebStorm and related IDEs](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2017/06/webstorm-2017-2-eap-172-2827/), or with some [manual steps](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34943631/path-aliases-for-imports-in-webstorm).

At start-up WebStorm will report in the *Event Log* that "Module resolution rules from `webpack.config.js` are now used for coding assistance" if the configuration is automatically identified -- if not, follow the manual steps:

1. Right-click on the `lib` directory and select `Mark Directory as > Resource root`
2. From the application menu select `Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript > Webpack` then in the right-hand pane use the file browser to select `webpack.config.js` from the package root

You shouldn't need to restart but it won't hurt.
